## 🔗 How It Works

The extension connects to the DLMan desktop app running on your computer.

**Requirements:**
- DLMan desktop app must be running
- Default integration port: `7899` (configurable in DLMan Settings → Extensions)

When you click a download link or right-click → "Download with DLMan", the extension sends the URL to DLMan, which handles the download with:
- Multi-segment parallel downloading
- Pause and resume capability
- Queue management
- Speed limiting

## ⚙️ Settings

Click the extension icon → Settings to configure:

- **Auto-intercept** — Capture downloads automatically
- **File patterns** — Which file types to intercept
- **Disabled sites** — Sites where DLMan won't intercept

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Extension not connecting?

1. Make sure DLMan desktop app is running
2. Check the connection port in DLMan Settings → Extensions
3. Look for the extension icon — a red badge means connection failed
4. Click the extension icon to see detailed connection status

### Downloads not being intercepted?

1. Verify the extension shows "Connected" when you click it
2. Check that "Auto-intercept downloads" is enabled
3. Verify the file type matches your intercept patterns
4. Make sure the website isn't in your disabled sites list
