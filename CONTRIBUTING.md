## 📝 Code Style

### TypeScript/React
- Strict mode enabled, avoid `any` types
- One component per file
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports

### Rust
- Follow standard clippy lints
- Keep functions focused and small
- Document public APIs

### General
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic

## ✅ Testing

```bash
# Run Rust tests
cargo test

# Type check frontend
cd apps/desktop && pnpm tsc --noEmit
```
