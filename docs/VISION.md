# DLMan Vision

**Mission:** Build a free, modern download manager that makes IDM obsolete.

## Goals

1. **Fast** — Rust-powered, multi-segment downloads
2. **Beautiful** — Modern UI that doesn't look like 2005
3. **Cross-platform** — Windows, macOS, Linux
4. **Open** — MIT licensed, community-driven

## Why?

IDM costs $25+, only works on Windows, and looks outdated. DLMan is free, works everywhere, and has a modern interface.

## Roadmap

- Multi-segment parallel downloads
- Queue management
- Pause/resume
- SQLite persistence
- Per-download speed limits
- CLI tool
